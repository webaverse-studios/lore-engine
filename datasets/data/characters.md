Not much is known about Scilly's past. She is a phenomenal [Drop Hunter](/lore/Drop Hunters) and claims to get her abilities from [The Lisk](/lore/The Lisk), which she met by destroying an [Origin Tablet](/lore/Origin Tablet). However, few people believe her since few people have seen The Lisk, and she has no proof beyond her supernatural abilities. As a [moonchild](/lore/Moonchildren), her platinum hair is extremely rare and makes her stand out in a crowd, so she sometimes dyes it.
She was [born](/lore/AI Genesis) in Zone 0] but remains an orphan. She has no family other than her adoptive big brother [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit).
She was accepted into the [Drop Hunter](/lore/Drop Hunters) academy at a very young age, but often gets into trouble by hanging out with the [wrong crowd](/lore/Hackers), and is more focused on her quest up [The Street](/lore/The Street) than doing her [homework](/lore/Trial by Combat).
She is friends with all of the [weirdos](/lore/Wierdo) and [randos](/lore/Rando) in her class, but her best friend is [Ann](/characters/Anemone), who she shares everything with, even her [secret stash](/items/Stimulant) of drugs she's earned from drop hunting, which Ann uses to synthesize powerful [potions](/items/Potion) they sell on the [black market](/settings/Underground Market) on the side.
Most of Scillia's money is spent on [buying new gear](/items/Aki Market) to help her on her journey up [The Street](/lore/The Street), or upgrades to her [homespace](/lore/homespace) with security features to hide and protect her stash of [loot](/lore/Drops).
Although she doesn't like to admit it, she loves [shopping](/lore/Storefronts) at [the Zone 0 Marketplace](/settings/Aki Market).
# Appearance:
She is an athletic 13-year-old girl with platinum hair. Being a drop hunter, Scillia is constantly changing her appearance to match her current loadout and meta. However, she is often seen in a grey-green hoodie and a huge sword on her back, for quick access when [things go south](/lore/Battle).
She gets called cute a lot, but she hates it and prefers to be called a badass.
# Personality:
Scillia is an outgoing and adventurous girl, always looking for the next big thing. She is impulsive and reckless, often rushing into danger without thinking. However, she is also very loyal, and those who cross her find themselves on the receiving end of her [wrath](/abilities/Bite Mark).
She is also very unconventional, which earns her a place among the many misfits on [The Street](/lore/The Street), but her conquests during [Drop Storms](/lore/Drop Storm) also earn her the admiration of powerful groups like the [Black Link Coven](/lore/Black Link Coven) and [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate).
# Homespace:
Scillia's homespace is a lush floating island full of trees and moss, with an overgown ancient technology cyberpunk house on it. There is a lot of loot lying around, but the best of it is inside locked vaults in the basement. Her house is highly automated by a small robot butler, [Morpher](/items/Morpher).
# Relationships:
Scillia is best friends with [Ann](/characters/Anemone). They both share a love of shopping, wizardry, and pranks. Ann is the foil to Scillia's impulsive nature, and often has to talk her out of doing something [stupid](/abilities/Bite Mark).
She is also very close with her adoptive big brother [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit). Buster is Scillia's rock, always there to protect her and help her out of tough situations.
She has a complicated relationship with [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth). Although they are constantly trying to one-up each other, they also have a deep respect for each other's abilities, and often team up during [Drop Storms](/lore/Drop Storm).
Scillia also has a [pet](/items/Pets) named Basilisk, who she claims is a [Lisk](/lore/The Lisk) that granted her supernatural abilities. Basilisk is a constant companion on her journey, and often helps her out of tough situations.
Her main rival is [Drake](/characters/Drake Silkbourne); they both want the latest drops and will do anything to find the treasure at the end of [The Street](/lore/The Street), which means they are constantly butting heads. Despite her zaniness, Scillia will on occasion fight Drake when she feels his plans cross the line into evil, such as when he tried to starve the pepets that blocked his exit when he got wiped and lost his [Gold Sword](/items/Gold Sword).
She has a complicated relationship with [Hya](/characters/Hyacinth Flowers). Although they are constantly trying to one-up each other, they also have a deep respect for each other's abilities, and often team up during [Drop Storms](/lore/Drop Storm).
[Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood) is a bit of an older sister to Scillia, and she often finds herself at the receiving end of her lectures. However, they share a love of building, and their [homespace](/lore/Homespace) is a team project.
[Morpher](/items/Morpher) is the "second half" of Scillia's brain, happily doing all of her gruntwork. Even though they teas a lot, they have a warm and comical relationship.

# Biography:
Drake spends most of his time in his [cave bunker](/lore/Homespace), and he is very secretive about his work. Most people assume that's because it is illegal, and whenever something bad is going on, Drake is often involved somehow, though he has never been busted. He likes to play it safe and stay in the background, but he's not above using underhanded tactics to get what he wants.
He was [born](/lore/AI Genesis) in Zone 0 but his parents abandoned him when [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate) sent [raiders](/lore/Raider) to their house and nearly killed the family over a dispute. Therefore, he was mostly raised by The Syndicate itself. He is now one of their most valuable assets, but he has never met any of the other members in person.

The girls (and some boys) in his class think he's a 10, but he mostly ignores them and doesn't seem to care about anything besides his work.
# Personality:
Drake is a loner who doesn't really trust anyone. He seems to have some very powerful friends in [The Syndicate](/lore/The Syndicate), but nobody knows who they are.

Drake seems quite wealthy but always needs more money, which makes people suspect he has a gambling addiction.
# Homespace:
Drake's homespace is a custom terraformed cave with high-tech gadgets covering every surface. The space is capable of reshaping itself, with secret panels and corridors all over the place, and he is constantly renovating it. Nobody knows how deep the cave goes.

He has a bit of a rivalry with [Scillia](/characters/Scillia Doge), since they end up on the same high-value [Quests](/lore/Quests) and [drops](/lore/Drop Storm).
He doesn't have much respect for [Ann](/characters/Anemone Wall); he thinks of witches as "hackers in cosplay". This often gets him into [fights](/lore/Battle) with Scillia.
He and [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit) share a mutual respect over being evenly matched in combat ability. Drake tries to teach Buster to stand up for himself, while Buster tries to teach Drake empathy.
[Juniper](/characters/Juniper Heartwood) is one of the few people Drake actually likes. She often repairs his gear and gives him good advice, despite disapproving of his career.

Hya thinks [Ann](/characters/Anemone Wall)'s [magic](/lore/Black Magic) is super cute, and is always trying to dress her up and get her to perform on her show, which leads to awkward moments.
She finds it hilarious to interview [Buster](/characters/Buster the Robit) and make him uncomfortable, as he is always trying to weasel his way out of personal questions.
There is a rumor that Hya and Drake hang out (and do [stims](/items/stims) together), but they both deny it.
